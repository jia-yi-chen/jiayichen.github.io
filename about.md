<!-- Overview -->


<!-- <p style="padding-left: 35px;"> <b>Since 2018</b>:</p> -->

<!-- #### **Since 2018**: -->
<!-- - **Learning from Multimodal, Multi-view, and Heterogeneous Data** 
  - Work1: Heterogeneous **graph neural network**  for incomplete multimodal data analysis.

## **Projects (CV/CG directions)**

- **Artwork Generation for 3D Scene Models based on Computer Vision & Graphics** 
  - Studied human knowledge-guided neural style transfer, focusing on improving the illusion of space in generated images by simulating how artists use their skills to observe and reproduce a 3D scene (e.g., geometric structures, lighting and shallow); also studied 3D non-photorealistic rendering based on the neural style transfer paradigm.
  - Created a 3D-2D dataset, including 3D models rendered by multiple types of lighting (using Autodesk Maya), 2D photos annotated by lighting and segmentation (by Photoshop and Matlab), and a hand-drawn stylistic material for testing (by CorelPainter).
  - Proposed an illumination-guided deep alignment method based on CNN, Lighting Path Expression, and PatchMatch (Keras, Python).
- **Traffic-scene Image Enhancement** 
  - Proposed a fast, detail-enhanced, and halo-free method to simultaneously correct the over- and under-exposure problem in LDR images, which widely exists in traffic-scene images in our smart-vehicle vision system.
- **Efficient Human Action Recognition based on Video-Compression Domain** 
  - Extracted motion vectors (MV) and DCT from MPEG-4 video bitstreams.
  - Proposed to fast detect Spatial-Temporal Interest Points from video bitstream using MV and DCT, instead of from the decoded video, and then formed action features using BoW and GMM.
  - Trained traditional ML classifiers-decision tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
  - *Tools*: Matlab, C++, OpenCV, ffmpeg, Linux.

## **Projects (Robotics direction)**

- **TurtleBot Autonomous Security Guard** 
  - Built an autonomous framework on TurtleBot to act as a human security guard—wandering, finding AprilTag targets, approaching each target, aiming and then shooting the target with a motorized toy gun installed on TurtleBot. 
  - Developed the target searching/ranking, goal-position and gun-pitch calculation, and go-to-goal functions.
  - *Tools*: Robotic Operating System (ROS), C++,  Python, Linux


- **Drone Vision-guided Autonomous Navigation & Search-and-rescue System** 
  - Centered around a mission making the drone to complete a search-and-rescue task. Participants are tasked with building an app that enables a drone to autonomously take-off from a moving vehicle, collect data in a survivors searching area, and finally track and land on the moving vehicle.
  - Developed a real-time vision-based module on drone system for Object Detection and 3D Localization, computing the 3D poses of objects from 2D images using real-time camera gimbal, Homography and 3D Transformation (C++).
  - Developed a PID-based autonomous tracking-and-landing module for landing on a moving vehicle, and developed the workflow module to manage the multiple modules simultaneously running on the drone (ROS, Python, Linux).
  - Won the 4th place from 130+ international teams in “2016 DJI Developer Challenge”, NY, USA (as a team of three).
  - *Tools*: Robotic Operating System (ROS), C++,  Python, Linux
